          <p>The film is set in a large, tower-style "Vertical Self-Management Center". Its residents, who are periodically switched at random between its many floors, are fed via a platform which, initially filled with food at the top floor, gradually descends through the tower's levels, each level getting only the leftovers from the previous ones. It is a system bound to cause conflict, as the residents at the top levels can eat as much as they can, leaving increasingly little for those below.</p>
